      <description>Questions of Time, Power, Praise  The notion of a &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; community seems pretty unique to Reddit, since it has self-contained subreddits.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this as I wait to be assigned to an RCC compute node for my thesis work. It took me the better part of a day, but I think I know how to solve my large-scale entropy calculation conundrum.</description>
