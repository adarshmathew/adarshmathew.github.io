      <description>Next on the self-hosting bender  It&amp;rsquo;s been a solid 4 months since I began tinkering with Docker and self-hosting. I think of this as digital hobbyist carpentry, the way you build birdhouses for yourself.</description>

      <description>tl;dr: Use codebooks, move away from auto-generated unsupervised topics.  This idea is completely due to Benjamin Guinaudeau&amp;rsquo;s great tweet.</description>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly cogent post. I intend to come back to this as I work through the ideas.
One question from the great participants at INDE-21 has stayed with me, months after the conference: Given what you&amp;rsquo;ve shown and argued about elite users, is there something about them or the associations that they form that would help us intervene and alter the dynamics of that subreddit?</description>

      <description>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it: As a practicing data scientist/junkie, I picked up Docker only after spending days trying to install the unholy combination of nvidia-cudatoolkit packages for PyTorch on my laptop with a measly GPU.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this as I wait to be assigned to an RCC compute node for my thesis work. It took me the better part of a day, but I think I know how to solve my large-scale entropy calculation conundrum.</description>
