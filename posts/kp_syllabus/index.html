<h1 id="syllabus-knowledge-politics">Syllabus &ndash; Knowledge &amp; Politics</h1>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>Please see the draft syllabus for Knowledge and Politics, below. This course is primarily aimed at graduate students but is open to a limited number of advanced undergraduates as well. If you are an undergraduate interested in enrolling in the course, please send me an email.</p>

<p>PLSC 42502: Knowledge and Politics:
    Winter 2020
    Tuesdays 9:30-12:20, Foster 105</p>

<p>Instructor: Matthew Landauer (landauer@uchicago.edu)</p>

<p><strong>DRAFT SYLLABUS: READINGS AND ASSIGNMENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE</strong></p>

<p>In this course we examine the relationship between knowledge and politics. Does it matter whether our political institutions produce ‘correct’ outcomes &ndash; and can we even make sense of such a standard? What do democratic citizens need to know and understand to participate effectively in democratic politics, and what are the obstacles to gaining such competencies? Are there ways to democratize the distribution and production of the knowledge necessary for politics, or is such knowledge bound to be the province of experts? Can experts be controlled and harnessed, or is reliance on expertise akin to the usurpation or depoliticization of democracy? And how can the distribution of knowledge itself be a source of injustice?  We will take up these and related questions through reading and discussing works by political theorists, philosophers, and social scientists.</p>

<h2 id="texts">Texts</h2>

<p>Please purchase or otherwise acquire the following books:</p>

<p>John Dewey, The Public and its Problems, edited by Melvin Rogers (Swallow Press, 2016 &ndash; please be sure to get the correct edition!)</p>

<p>Miranda Fricker, Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing  (Oxford, 2007)</p>

<p>James Scott, Seeing Like a State (Yale, 1999)</p>

<p>All other readings will be posted to the course website a week (or more) in advance of the relevant class meeting.</p>

<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<p>Participation: 20%. Students should come to class having done the readings and prepared to discuss them critically. Attendance at all seminar meetings is required, except in cases of illness, personal emergency, or religious observance. Please email me beforehand (if possible) if such a circumstance obtains.</p>

<p>Handouts: 20%. Each week, one or more students will be responsible for creating 1-2 page handouts with key passages, sketches of arguments, and discussion questions pertaining to one or two of that week’s readings. Handouts should be emailed to me the night before class; I will print and distribute them to everyone the following morning. We will use the handouts as a starting point for our discussion that day.</p>

<p>I will explain the requirements further on the first day of class.</p>

<p>Final paper: 60%. A ~20 page paper on a topic of your own choosing will be due on the Tuesday of finals week. Students should meet with me by the end of sixth week to discuss their intended paper topics.</p>
