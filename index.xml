      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s weekly CSS Workshop, we had a duo from AirBnB presenting work on &amp;lsquo;Designing for Trust&amp;rsquo; in the context of the sharing economy. The paper had an interesting design &amp;ndash; they set up an investment game to construct their dependent variable of &amp;lsquo;Trust&amp;rsquo;, and used the participants&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;behavioural&amp;rsquo; data logs to identify what behaviours predicted propensity to trust among users. They had a particularly interesting &amp;lsquo;data triangulation&amp;rsquo; step, where they measured the validity of their trust construct using good ol&amp;rsquo; survey data, all to see if their construct was capturing the right indicators of trust in a completely different context.</description>

      <description>Adarsh Mathew Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m currently a graduate student in the Masters in Computational Social Science program at the University of Chicago. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been working with Prof. James Evans at the Knowledge Lab since Summer 2020.
My Masters thesis (a work-in-progress) tries to explore the narrative and dissemination network of claims in the QAnon universe using a computational framework. I hope to describe and investigate how these claims propagate in user networks on Reddit &amp;amp; Twitter, what counts as &amp;lsquo;knowledge&amp;rsquo; in these communities, and how they adapt in a decentralized fashion in response to platform incentives.</description>

      <description>Goldman paper Individual Epistemology: (traditional) Mental ps of cognitive agents in isolation or abstraction from other persons.
Social Epistemology: Social paths to knowledge; many routes to belief that feature interactions with other agents
Veritistic Epistemology: Prod of knowledge (true belief), error (false belief), ignorance (absence of true belief)
 Main question for veritistic epistemology is: Which practices have a comparatively favorable impact on knowledge as contrasted with error and ignorance?</description>
