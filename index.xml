      <description>So pip got a great birthday gift which was right on theme with our recent Castle binge. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Death at the Dive Bar&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;Hunt a Killer&amp;rdquo;, which also runs a subscription service.</description>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a particularly cogent post. I intend to come back to this as I work through the ideas.

      <description>Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it: As a practicing data scientist/junkie, I picked up Docker only after spending days trying to install the unholy combination of nvidia-cudatoolkit packages for PyTorch on my laptop with a measly GPU.</description>

      <description>Questions of Time, Power, Praise  The notion of a &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; community seems pretty unique to Reddit, since it has self-contained subreddits.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this as I wait to be assigned to an RCC compute node for my thesis work. It took me the better part of a day, but I think I know how to solve my large-scale entropy calculation conundrum.</description>

      <description>While working with the Reddit data dumps for Ideolect, Jeremiah and I have often used the metaphor of the Reddit Universe: groups of subreddits form their own solar systems, with some long-range connections between others.</description>

      <description>This post stems from a big personal grouse of mine, and this twitter thread captures that perfectly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to reply on there because a) complex conversations on Twitter sucks, and b) this wasn&amp;rsquo;t my conversation to butt into.</description>

      <description>Spending time with pip has given me a more close-up window of insight into her life in graduate school.

      <description>Reportage can be boiled down to an abstract representation of entities (person, place, organization, ideology, it&amp;rsquo;s quite broad) and relationships (could be an action, could be a dependence, it&amp;rsquo;s very vague, honestly).</description>
