			<p>In the words of Vicki Boykis or Chris Albon or Emily Reidereere (idk): write the tutorial you wish you had when you were digging around the internet. And so I&rsquo;m writing this after I couldn&rsquo;t resolve this issue in time for a WWW submission. You learn from your shortcomings, amirite?</p>
<p>So, the problem I had was this: I had to iterate over 48 (12 months * 4 years) massive compressed NDJSON files to create multi-layer interaction graphs using graph_tool (more on this later). I thought I did the requisite smart^TM thing by using GNU parallel on SLURM to operate on each of these files independently, using pandas to build the edgelists.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong.</p>
<p>After spending the better part of 24 hours trying to tinker and expand the RAM requirements (apologies to my PI&rsquo;s account), I realized that pandas just couldn&rsquo;t scale to carry out an inner join on potentially 7 billion+ edges. Even if I tried to chunk and partition the joins by subreddit. I spent another 6 hours in trying to do the same thing with Dask, but I couldn&rsquo;t get anywhere &ndash; partly because I haven&rsquo;t used much of Dask before, partly because I was burning out.</p>
<p>So, after discussing with Jeremiah, we thought a good way to sample the subreddits of interest would be to cap them at a nice sounding number like 10k, based on their unique commenter count. But the original reason as to why we wanted to pull all the subreddits in first is because some of them may be below our arbitrary threshold in their early days or after a ban/suspension period (and these would be the most interesting ones to look at).</p>
<p>So my (new) problem now became this: how do I parse these massive NDJSON files and aggregate them by their unique commenter count? Sure, I could rely on GNU parallel to iterate over the individual files, but going the python-pandas route would drag me into my old memory-error hell.</p>
<p>This is where I discover the nifty jq tool. I wish I knew of this earlier.</p>
